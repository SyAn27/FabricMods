# Todo
- Port mods to 1.16 ( except creative button mover )
- Make it so chainmail-config requires a config supplier instead of using class.newInstance ( non-issue 1.16 )
- Fix chainmail-config config merging bug ( non-issue 1.16 )
- Make sure chainmail BlockEntity#onLoad is patched
- Release mods.
# Other Todo
- Look into forge data generators for generating both forge and fabric datapacks ( since there's no inbuilt way in fabric ecosystem yet )
